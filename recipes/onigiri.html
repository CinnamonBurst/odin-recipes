    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>You might have had Onigiri in the past while visiting your favourite Sushi restaurant.<br>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol name="instructions">
        <li>Wash the rice until the water is clear. Put it into a pot and add some water and salt.<br>
            Heat it until the water is cooking and immediately turn it down to a simmer.<br>
            Put a lid on the pot and let the rice sit (stir it occasionaly!).<br>
            Spread the rice out on a baking tray and marinate it with rice wine vinegar as soon as it stops to give off steam.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>For the first filling wash and dry the shallots before cutting them into little rolls.<br>
            Chop up the kimchi and put both the shallots and the kimchi into a bowl.<br>
            Give it a good toss!
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>For the second filling rinse the salmon with cold water.<br>
            Dab it dry with a sheet of kitchen paper.<br>
            Slice the salmon into little chunks (think of sushi!).<br>
            Peel the cucumber and chop it into little chunks.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>For the third and last filling we will heat up a bit of oil in a pan and add ground ginger.<br>
            Rinse the chicken with cold water, dab it dry with a piece of kitchen paper and chop it into little chunks.<br>
            Add the chicken to the pan including the teriyaki sauce and edamame.<br>
            Stir it up good and fry it for around five minutes (keep stirring!).            
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Wet your hands with water, take a bit of our rice and form a light mold so it can hold the fillings.<br>
            Take a bit of the desired filling, put it into the mold and roll the rice into a ball, encapsulating the filling inside.<br>
            Now shape it into a triangle, put a dash of soy sauce on it and it's ready to be server.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            If you don't want to eat your Onigiri right away you can wrap them in nori sheets for later.<br>
            The nori sheets will make it easier to put two or more Onigiri next to each other since it prevents them from sticking to each other.
