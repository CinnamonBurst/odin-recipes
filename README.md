A simple HTML consisting of a couple food recipes.

The first project of "The Odin Project" (TOP) requires one to make a HTML website using links, images, ordered and unordered lists as well as headers, paragraphs and of course the HTML boilerplate.
This first project concludes the first review of all basics that have been taught until now.

The theme of this first project is "food recipes".
